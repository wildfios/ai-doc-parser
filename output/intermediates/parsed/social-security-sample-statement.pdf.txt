Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people: • age 65 and older, • under 65 with certain disabilities, and • of any age with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant). Even if you do not retire at age 65, you may need to sign up for Medicare within 3 months of your 65th birthday to avoid a lifetime late enrollment penalty . Special rules may apply if you are covered by certain group health plans through work.

You may need other savings, investments, pensions, or retirement accounts to make sure you have enough money when you retire. • You need at least 10 years of work (40 credits) to qualify for retirement benefits. Your benefit amount is based on your highest 35 years of earnings. If you have fewer than 35 years of earnings, years without work count as 0 and may reduce your benefit amount. • To keep up with inflation, benefits are adjusted through “cost of living adjustments.” • If you get retirement or disability benefits, your spouse and children may qualify for benefits. • When you apply for either retirement or spousal benefits, you may be required to apply for both benefits at the same time. • If you and your spouse both work, use the my Social Security Retirement Calculator to estimate spousal benefits. • The age you claim benefits will affect the benefit amount for your surviving spouse. For example, claiming benefits after your full retirement age may increase the Spouse, if benefits start at full retirement age amount on page 1; claiming early may reduce it. • If you are divorced and were married for 10 years, you may be able to claim benefits on your ex-spouse’s record. If your ex-spouse receives benefits on your record, that does not affect your or your current spouse’s benefit amounts. • If you receive a pension from earnings not covered by Social Security, your benefits may have been reduced prior to January 2024. The Social Security Fairness Act ended the Windfall Elimination Provision and Government Pension Offset.
